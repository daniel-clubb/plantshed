        PlantShed debuted their floral cafés in 2018 in both Nolita and on the Upper West Side. The concept introduced a unique retail experience incorporating both a traditional floral and plant shop with a wellness-focused café. Challenging what a conventional retail space should entail, PlantShed’s floral cafes emphasize a lifestyle centered around nature. A lush oasis filled with tropical foliage, cacti, and succulents along with premium flowers sourced from all over the world creates a space where busy New Yorkers can slow down and embrace café culture in its most unique form.
